Promises outline 

- Tutorial with intention of clarifying the differences between callbacks and promises, pros and cons of both 

- Uses test specs to get you to reconfigure promises into correct usage 

- Use as simplistic examples as possible, to maybe avoid using database calls in case the person using tutorial is not yet a developer and simply wants to understand promises/callbacks 

- maybe use the node/fs library promisified, so that usesr can simply re-arrange files around in the tutorial pp itself 

- would give us a greater understanding of buffor objects and how to handle them 

- would give us a better understanding of test specs
